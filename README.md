# PS4 Keyboard and Mouse Adapter 
(if you come up with a sexier name, feel free to give me suggestions [and no, I don't like "IPS4 X" :smile:])

## How to use

(currently working on the tutorial)

## To-do list:
- Make mouse settings configurable
- Improve the UI
- Silently auto-update client at startup
- Distribute updates as github release assets

## Why this and not REM4P?

I learned about REM4P's existence after I wrote this tool. I checked it out and I have to give props to the dev - he's done a damn good job. The app works good, great website, documentation, and tutorial. Things you might not like are: it requires a plugged-in DS4 controller at all times instead of emulating it, also it's paid, no trial, non-refundable, and the forums are locked for reading if you are not a member.

What this app does that REM4P doesn't:
- fully emulates a ds4 controller - you don't need to buy one and keep it plugged-in
- it's free

## Credits

- [PS4Macro](https://github.com/komefai/PS4Macro) - Big thanks to komefai for making and open-sourcing this tool. I've grown a lot as a developer by reading and learning from his code, I'd never have started doing this if hadn't stumbled on PS4Macro. Komefai is MIA for 2 years and his repo is not supported anymore but you can still write pretty good bots with it, definitely check it out if you are into that kind of stuff
- [EasyHook](https://easyhook.github.io) - The best tool for Windows API hooking. Perfectly implemented - from the assembly injection, to the hook trampoline code
- [Jays2Kings/DS4Windows](https://github.com/Jays2Kings/DS4Windows) - don't need to explain that one
