- [PS4Macro](https://github.com/komefai/PS4Macro) - Big thanks to komefai for making and open-sourcing this tool. Komefai is MIA for 2 years and his repo is not supported anymore but you can still write pretty good bots with it, definitely check it out if you are into that kind of stuff
- [EasyHook](https://easyhook.github.io) - The best tool for Windows API hooking. Works flawlessly - from the assembly injection, to the hook trampoline code. ~~I haven't had a single problem with it~~ I had one but that doesn't make EasyHook any less cool
- [Jays2Kings/DS4Windows](https://github.com/Jays2Kings/DS4Windows) - don't need to explain that one
