## DOWNLOAD
:rocket: Click --> [here](https://github.com/starshinata/PS4-Keyboard-and-Mouse-Adapter/releases/download/1.0.7/Setup.exe) <-- to Download!


## How to use
1. Make sure you've enabled remote play from your PS4's settings menu. To do that:
  * Go to your PS4, select (Settings) -> [Remote Play Connection Settings], and then select the checkbox for [Enable Remote Play].
  * To activate it as your primary PS4, select  (Settings) -> [Account Management] -> [Activate as Your Primary PS4] -> [Activate].
2. Download and run the setup from the download link above. It will automatically do all the configuration stuff for you
3. If you want 0 lag, connect your PS4 to your TV/Monitor and watch the game from there (thus NOT from the Remote Play app)
4. That's it 

Do NOT plug your DS4 controller into your PC while using this tool. If it is plugged already, unplug it because it will interfere with the device emulation.

- [EasyHook](https://easyhook.github.io) - The best tool for Windows API hooking. Works flawlessly - from the assembly injection, to the hook trampoline code. ~~I haven't had a single problem with it~~ I had one but that doesn't make EasyHook any less cool
