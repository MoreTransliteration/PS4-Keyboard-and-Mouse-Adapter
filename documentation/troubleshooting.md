## Recommended user environment

* PS4 it connected to internet via Ethernet cable
  (this reduces lag, and make your PS4 more consistently find-able from the "PS Remote Play" application)

* PS4 use video from the monitor/TV it is plugged into
  (If you choose to use the video from the "PS Remote Play" then you are adding delay/lag which is generally undesired)

* The PS4 you are trying to connect to has Remote play enabled
  PS4 ->  select (Settings) -> [Remote Play Connection Settings], and then select the checkbox for [Enable Remote Play].

* The PS4 you are trying to connect to is set as your PSN account's Primary PS4
  PS4 -> select (Settings) -> [Account Management] -> [Activate as Your Primary PS4] -> [Activate].

* PS Remote Play application has its video settings set to the lowest
  (This should reduce the the amount of data your PS4 has to send, and how much your Remote Play application has to receive.)
  PS Remote Play application (without a an active device connected) -> "Settings" via the cod symbol -> "Video Quality for Remote Play" tab -> pick either PS4 or PS5 > Resolution set to lowest

* If you have a DS4 or DS5, unplug it from computer
  Either controller being plugged in can cause interference with this application


## Problems and fixes

#### Application says "need to  install remote play" but I already have it installed
If you are on PS4KeyboardAndMouseAdapter v1.0.7 or lower, you need to upgrade to a newer version. Sometime in October 2020 Sony issued a new version of "PS Remote Play" to support PS5, that broke some things in older versions of our application.
