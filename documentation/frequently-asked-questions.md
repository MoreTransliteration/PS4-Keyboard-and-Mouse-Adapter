# Frequently Asked Questions

Questions ordered alphabetically


### Can I get banned for using this application? 
I cannot find a specific text saying this is a bannable offense. But strictly because it is an unauthorised third party  I would not be surprised if SIE LLC (Sony) claimed that using this is a banable offense.

**No one has reported being banned for it.**


### Can this invalidate my Playstation warranty?

From the PS4 License agreement (checked 2020.11.24)

Source: https://www.playstation.com/en-us/legal/softwarelicense/

`
8. USE OF UNAUTHORIZED PRODUCTS. The use of software, peripherals or other products not authorized by SIE LLC may damage your PlayStation system and invalidate your PlayStation system warranty. Only official or licensed software and peripherals should be used with your PlayStation system (e.g., in the controller ports and memory card slots).
`

Because this software is not authorised by SIE LLC (Sony), this may technically " invalidate your PlayStation system warranty"


### I have a question or issue, why havent you replied?
We do this in our free time, and we have normaly 9-5 day jobs to contend with.

I would like to remind you this application is **free**.


### Is using a mouse and keyboard cheating?
No.

Sony has licensed Hori products https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/accessories/specialty-controllers/, and Hori has provided mouse and keyboard options https://www.amazon.co.uk/HORI-Tactical-Assault-Commander-Pro/dp/B01K7JEII8

If you are using an application to improve you aim or response time, that could be considered cheating. The developers of this application consider this a accessibility aid for people who have issues using a controller (I personally have RSI and cannot play with a controller for long periods of time, but can use a mouse and keyboard all day).

### How do I uninstall PS4 KMA?
goto `%AppData%\..\Local\PS4KeyboardAndMouseAdapter` in windows explorer and delete everything there
